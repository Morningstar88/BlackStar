ATTN TEMPLE FILM CREW

**AFFIDAVIT OF CREATIVE SERVICES & LIVESTREAM EXCHANGE OFFER**  
_By Jack Maclavity, semi-feral cortex hacker and music / software teacher_

I, Jack Maclavity—currently orbiting Siem Reap,—do hereby solemnly affirm that I’m ready to barter vids and rants in exchange for the following:

**I want:**
- Cold, crisp *cash*
- A quality microphone
- A recent model iPhone, unbricked and blessed
- Analog recording gear (tape decks, mixers, cassette oddities)
- Fruit salad (three colours of citrus, papaya, ginger, tomato )
- Chicken burgers, crocodile burgers, and jungle specials
- Other trades welcome—**no paperwork if you don't need it**, just **fair terms and industry standard profit sharing rates**

It is understood that AMC, Wanda Group, Stephen Goedhart and friends may not want to disclose past profts. This is fine for now, if I get a better stage deal.

I would also like some MP4 dumps of me driving with MAttprosser and Alisdair Dunsmuir. 

**I offer:**
- **Guitar tutorials** (3–5 minutes) in English, Chinese, Spanish, and barely-there pidgin Czech, Khmer, and Indonesian  
- **Coding instruction** for JavaScript and **SCSS**, same language set  
- **Rants**, glorious and petty, scorched-earth takes on institutions, neighbors, and conceptual frameworks  
- **Farming know-how**, **prompt engineering**, and pop commentary (T’Pau deep cuts? “House of the Rising Sun” dissected syllable by syllable? I got you)

**I need some assistance with**

- Location scouting. Hostels, cafes, places by the river. Open to ideas. 
- Casting. Finding Khmer teachers, guitar students, linguists on Telegram or elsewhere.
- If I have stage cash, or worthwhile trades, I can hire more people, get better clothes and music equipment, and make a better, happier feed.

**Payment schemes accepted:**
- Per video  
- Per minute  
- Per hour  
- Per lucrative, surreal day

**All I ask:**
No NDAs, no tax forms, no weird client docs. You respect the terms laid bare here and I’ll deliver content like Case jacked into cyberspace on a caffeine IV.

I prefer no monthly, yearly or exclusive deals. I want to work with a variety of indie streamers. If we keep it casual, it will benefit all of us. 

Relatively easy to negotiate with,

Signed,
